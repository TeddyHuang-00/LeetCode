# My LeetCode solutions in Rust

This repository contains my solutions to LeetCode problems in Rust. I am using this repository to learn Rust and code are not guaranteed to be the best solution, but they should work.

## Usage

To run the tests for a specific problem, use the following command:

```bash
cargo test <problem_number>
```

Or if you have task installed:

```bash
task test-<problem_number>
# or time it
task time-<problem_number>
# or watch it
task watch-<problem_number>
```
